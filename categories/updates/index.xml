Obsidian is a powerful and extensible knowledge base that works on top of your local folder of plain text files.
Had a random thought this evening, and wondered if anyone had ever used Obsidian to manage their Hugo-Based Blog. Looks like there are a few, but each implementation seems to differ wildly.</description></item><item><title>Move to Hugo</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2021/move-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 20:48:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2021/move-to-hugo/</guid><description>So this site has long be running on an older branch of a Jekyll theme, that was heavly modified. I have always had problems updating the site, not to mention getting Jekyll to run properly on Windows. Also, I am not a real fan of Ruby.
Last year during our horrible dark times, I set out to learn a new programming language. I had been messing with Golang for a little while, and I finally sat down with some awesome online classes from PluralSight, and really got to task.</description></item><item><title>New Domain, New Rules</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2016/new-domain-new-rules/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2016 13:05:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2016/new-domain-new-rules/</guid><description>So here we are&amp;hellip; After trying to keep this thing alive for way to long, I have decided to give it another shot.
So much of this site is my own personal musings and ramblings, that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I even remember where I was headed in the first place. I do have some interesting old posts, specifically about storage, tapes, and the cloud. Might be worth a read for someone.</description></item><item><title>Old Fortune City Site</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2010/old-fortune-city-site/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2010 17:58:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2010/old-fortune-city-site/</guid><description>While reviewing some of my old Hard-drives, I discovered that I had and copy of a site that I had build on Fortune City hosting. (Circa 1998) This would not have been my original site that I setup, but it is still old and crappy. My little home on the internet at that time was
http://www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/swampthing/104/ (Site predates the Internet Wayback Machine, so obviously dead link!)
This looks like an EARLY attempt to create a blog, before I even knew what a blog was.</description></item><item><title>Google Voice</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/google-voice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2009 19:17:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/google-voice/</guid><description>Yes! I finally got my invite to Google Voice (thank you EvilSkill9)!!
So far, so good. Everything looks pretty easy to setup. Looks like Google built in support for SMS messaging, and Voicemail. Aparently you can replace your standard Mobile Phone Voicemail for GV. Too Cool!
I am not sure if I am going to put the Voice App on the blog yet.</description></item><item><title>Shutting down Blogspot</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/shutting-down-blogspot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Sep 2009 01:59:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/shutting-down-blogspot/</guid><description>So, after a full year on this new blog I have decided to get rid of the old blog&amp;hellip;
I started amanoj.blogspot.com in July of 2003. Back then, I was still &amp;ldquo;Wet-Behind-the-Ears&amp;rdquo; about the whole blogging thing&amp;hellip; but I decided to give it a shot. Who knew that 6 years later, I would still be updating a site from time to time.
Blogger.com is a fantastic service for people who are just starting out (how I was) blogging.</description></item><item><title>Whats up all!!</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/whats-up-all/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2009 03:23:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/whats-up-all/</guid><description>I am still here. Thankfully my hosting company got their act&amp;rsquo;s together, and now we have plenty of bandwith to support this blog. Recently post have been just my Delicious bookmarks, which are posted to the blog on a nightly basis. (I will do a follow-up post on how to do that.)
Just an update of what I am working on&amp;hellip;
Upgrading our BlueCoat SG Proxy from an SG400 to a SG510.</description></item><item><title>Still Here People...</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/still-here-people/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2009 01:08:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/still-here-people/</guid><description>Yep, I am still here on this site. I was having a few problems with my webhost earlier this month, but those should all be resolved by now. (I hope!)
Whats new in my life you ask&amp;hellip; well lets see:
Completed a Data Center re-cabling job in less than 72 hours! That was no easy feat, involving most of my staff to give up a weekend to get it done. Looks great though, I will have to put up some photos of the finished product.</description></item><item><title>Lets try that again...</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/lets-try-that-again/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2009 07:02:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/lets-try-that-again/</guid><description>I am happy to announce the re-opening of this blog! ~w00t! :)
A special Thank You to my new provider Hosting Puppy for the site &amp;amp; the fantastic support.
After 3 unsuccessful hosting providers and 2 site-wide data corruption issues, one would think that I would learn from my mistakes.
Oh well, 4th times the charm!
The only good news is that I am now extremely perficent at re-building my Wordpress site.</description></item><item><title>Windows 7 Features Demo</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2008/windows-7-features-demo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2008 01:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2008/windows-7-features-demo/</guid><description>Did I miss something?

This has been a fun event so far. We have been fed on a regular basis, and Pulvermedia has sprung for the Top-Shelf Liquor. I did get to spend a lot of time with Marc Spencer w/ Digium. Great guy, and soooo damn young! I have a few more hours here before catching a plane, so lets see what-else this conference has in store.</description></item><item><title>Road to AsteriskWorld</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2008/road-2-asteriskworld/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2008 09:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2008/road-2-asteriskworld/</guid><description>One other thing. I am going to be in the San Jose area next-week for the AsteriskWorld convention.

Just as an FYI of what I have been working on in the past 6 - 9 months:
Implementing a 300+ user Asterisk Implementation Re-vising the companies SOX controls. Creating new IT Procedures, revising old ones. Finishing up a massive NetBackup deployment. Completing an Internal Process Walkthrough. (One every year!) Planning our VMWare V3i implementation.

Both of us are IT Professionals, and have many years experience. Instead of being greedy and not sharing, we decided to listen to Tux &amp;amp; share the wealth of knowledge to the public.
So check it out&amp;hellip; its called &amp;ldquo;Communication Meltdown&amp;rdquo; and its LIVE!!
I will still be posting on this blog, but most of the technical stuff will be posted on the new blog.</description></item><item><title>I'm Back!!</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2005/i-am-back/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2005 06:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2005/i-am-back/</guid><description>Its been awhile&amp;hellip; and all I can say is Im Back!
I have been extremely busy for the past year, what with the massive undertaking of my Companies Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, and managing the entire department while our new Director got up to speed. Not an easy task!
But now I&amp;rsquo;m back&amp;hellip; and I plan to put this blog to good use!
So&amp;hellip; to start of on the right foot, I am going to be documenting one of my many projects:</description></item><item><title>Google Mail Address</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2004/google-mail-address/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2004 08:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2004/google-mail-address/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;ooo000OOO FINALLY!!

As a Birthday Present for my 29th Birthday (Today.), my wife bought me a motorcycle.
(Can you believe it?? What a Gal!)
I have been_ pining_ for an older bike, so I can fix it up and not have to worry about some serious monetary commitments.

I&amp;rsquo;m not very thrilled! :(
I am having recurring problems where I keep loosing sync on new 6.0/768 install at my house.
Covad is comming to do a line test. Probably going to tell me that I am 14,999.8 miles from the C.O., and to suck it up and like it.
If that happens, must convince my boss to let me expense a wireless T-1.</description></item><item><title>What...

Hopefully this day will END SOON! :(
Todays thoughts&amp;hellip;
Google Mail sounds cool. Gmail sounds even cooler, but I need an invite. (Please!) Cisco gear is so mother-effing Expensive! Oh, did I mention that a Gmail invite would be Awesome! 😀 Don&amp;rsquo;t pay any attention to me, I am just really tired!</description></item><item><title>Friends, Parting is such Sweet Sorrow...</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/friends-parting-is-such-sweet-sorrow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2003 00:01:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/friends-parting-is-such-sweet-sorrow/</guid><description>Man, I am so bummed out!
Gerald (G-Dog, or EvilSkill9), my right hand-man for like 8 years has left California.
He is heading east, out to Ohio to start a new life with his girl.
Good for him&amp;hellip;. but I allready miss the bastard!
I can&amp;rsquo;t even imagine what our phone bills are going to be like. 😄
The reality has just kicked in, but I am a little far from sobbing&amp;hellip; 😢</description></item><item><title>General Nothingness...</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/general-nothingness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2003 07:25:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/general-nothingness/</guid><description>Really tired right about now&amp;hellip;
I am snagging a few albums and trying to finish The Hulk, all while still at the office! 😀
Terminator 3 was pretty decent! I was not expecting the ending.
A round of kudos to the writers for an excellent script. Too bad they charge ten effing dollars ($10) to go see a movie.
Oh well, must get a hole saw kit to drill a BIG HOLE in my tower.</description></item><item><title>Randomness</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/randomness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2003 23:12:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/randomness/</guid><description>I guess that I&amp;rsquo;m being a nice guy today.
I am giving all the peeps @ work a crack at the new Terminator 3, and other movies that I have downloaded recently.
Even though its my effing BANDWITH! Nobody else seems to care, or contribute (i.e. download) anything! All exept for T-Dogg!
T-Dog&amp;rsquo;s my Hero! 😀
Peace&amp;hellip; Love&amp;hellip; and Chicken Wings!</description></item><item><title>Torrentness</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/torrentness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2003 06:41:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/torrentness/</guid><description>Ok, going to go to sleep now people!
The move that I am downloading, Terminator 3 is at 98% completion. This movie is taking FOREVER to download!
😢
Will have for tomorrow to watch it.
Now, if I could only find my damn power adapter for my drill&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Infectious Grooves</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/infectious-grooves/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2003 01:35:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/infectious-grooves/</guid><description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that I am still so sick!
This really sucks&amp;hellip;
Although, the thought of walking around @ Work and Infecting innocent bystanders with whatever pestilence I have growing inside of me is amusing!
I wonder if I would get fired for sending my Boss home sick? I might just go wipe my nose all over his hankerchief (sic).
There is a reason why I should stay home when I am like this&amp;hellip; I have lots of Evil Thoughts like these!</description></item></channel></rss>
