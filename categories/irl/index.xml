My tastes have changed over the years, and I am more of a social driker now, but I still enjoy my liquid bread!
I tend to gravitate towards Hazy &amp;amp; Double IPA&amp;rsquo;s, but one of my all-time favorites types of beers is Belgian Tripel&amp;rsquo;s. My absolute special being the St. Brnardus Abt 12, which is actually a Belgian Quad!
I am not alone in that sentement, as it is widely regarded as one of the best beers in the world.</description></item><item><title>Ski Jump IPA</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/ski-jump-ipa/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 18:15:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/ski-jump-ipa/</guid><description>Hoppy IPA&amp;rsquo;s are just damn refreshing! I tend to like Hop-Forward IPA&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; as well as Hazy&amp;rsquo;s. A good strong flavor, without a huge bitter bite is more my style.
As a Newcomer to the UP area, I have been exploring the local breweries in the area for hidden jems! So far, I have been impressed with the selections including the 51st State Brewing Company !
The pub food is excellent. I would suggest their Pizza&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; as they are cooked in a wood fired oven.</description></item><item><title>The Vagabond House</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/vagabond/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2020 15:45:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/vagabond/</guid><description>Well, thanks to Rocket Mortgage and the fine folks of Breitung Township&amp;hellip; I have purchased a nice small vacation home in Kingsford, MI.!!!
We are now live in the Upper Peninsula, or UP for short!
My wife is from the UP (Park Falls, WI specifically), and has done a lot of research on the Kingsford area. One of the things she discovered is that Henry Ford and his friends used to have a house they used in the summer for shenanigans in the early 1900&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item></channel></rss>
