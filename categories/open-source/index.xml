      <description>Jo-Gof Systrax Blogposted an article today on one of their many upcomming projects that they have been working on. plumTrack seems to provide some intresting reporting options for theÂ Open Source PBX software Asterisk. The product also provides integration to Plixer&amp;rsquo;s ownÂ Scrutinizergadgets, andÂ Maximizer EnterpriseCRM products.
Excerpt from the post&amp;hellip;

      <description>Found a very intresting piece of software called &amp;ldquo;Auditor&amp;rdquo;. (Actually its a compilation of software, on a bootable CD) Its bascially a rip of Kanotix, (Knoppix Clone) with a LOT of applications. Most notable is a copy of Kismet &amp;amp; Airdump. With these tools, you can WarDive an almost brute-force your way into a wi-fi network. Pretty cool. =D
I will be trying this later on!!!
Here is a link to the &amp;ldquo;Auditor&amp;rdquo; webpage&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Those Guys over at Team Cymru Research have done it again!
They have released a new version of their Darknet Project. For those unaware of what this is&amp;hellip; check it out!
 Tracking compromised machines can be difficult. Security solutions often don&amp;rsquo;t scale to the size of larger networks. Technologies such as IDS are flawed, producing copious false positives. When solutions are scaled to fit the larger providers, they often require considerable care and feeding, thus taking time away from problem mitigation.</description>

      <description>Discovered a great new article on how to build your own &amp;ldquo;Fairly-Secure Anti-SPAM Gateway&amp;rdquo; using a lot of Open-Source Software.
