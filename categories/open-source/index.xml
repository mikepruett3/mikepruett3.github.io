Had a random thought this evening, and wonderd if anyone had ever used Obsidian to manage their Hugo-Based Blog. Looks like there are a few, but each implementation seems to differ wildly.</description></item><item><title>plumTrack - A intresting new project from the Systrax team...</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/plumtrack-a-intresting-new-project-from-the-systrax-team/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2009 19:51:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/plumtrack-a-intresting-new-project-from-the-systrax-team/</guid><description>Jo-G of Systrax Blog posted an article today on one of their many upcomming projects that they have been working on. plumTrack seems to provide some intresting reporting options for theÂ Open Source PBX software Asterisk .

Tracking compromised machines can be difficult. Security solutions often don&amp;rsquo;t scale to the size of larger networks. Technologies such as IDS are flawed, producing copious false positives.
