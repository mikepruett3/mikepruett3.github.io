&amp;ndash; Already Started! &amp;ndash;
I thoroughly enjoyed the first season, and am looking forward to a fantastic new season this year. Plus, any show were Leonard Nemoy is acting has to be GOOD!</description></item><item><title>The Max Headroom Pirating Incident</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/the-max-headroom-pirating-incident/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2009 19:18:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/the-max-headroom-pirating-incident/</guid><description>Really interesting Documentary on the incident. Kind of makes you think about that struggle between Broadcasting Companies, and the Jackers who wanted to take over their airwaves.
I would assume that this trick is still possible in 3rd-World countries where the Media does not have the $$$ like US Broadcasters.
Plus&amp;hellip; Max Headroom was an awesome show! I miss a lot of the older/weirder shows from my youth.</description></item><item><title>The Binchotan Stove</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/binchotan-stove/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2009 19:00:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/binchotan-stove/</guid><description>Really cool stuff. I will have to try and make one of these. Binchotan is really expensive in this part of the country though!!</description></item><item><title>District 8 (Alive in Joburg)</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/district-8/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2009 00:34:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/district-8/</guid><description>So this past weekend I had a chance to see the new movie from director Neil Blomkamp, District 9. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen District 9 yet, you owe it to yourself to see this movie. The story is great, and the special effects are subtle yet impressive. The director has created a world were the main event is not the Aliens them selfs, but rather their environment &amp;amp; quest to go home.</description></item><item><title>I must have died an gone to heaven!</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/i-must-have-died-an-gone-to-heaven/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2009 23:51:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/i-must-have-died-an-gone-to-heaven/</guid><description>I cant believe that this is actually a reality, but one of my favorite horror movies has been transformed into a Musical!
Evil Dead the Musical
If your like me then you should have been a fan of Sam Rami&amp;rsquo;s first movie. Scary &amp;amp; Hilarious at the same time!</description></item><item><title>My love of separation...

A Letter to whom it concerns. Why does the world hate me so&amp;hellip;.. Or at least, why has NBC torn my mind asunder again?
Of course I am speaking metaphorically, but I sometimes ask myself this question. (Amongst many others.)
Tonight was the Season Finale of two of my favorite TV shows. For most of you who know me, I speak of Fox&amp;rsquo;s 24 &amp;amp; NBC&amp;rsquo;s Heroes.</description></item></channel></rss>
