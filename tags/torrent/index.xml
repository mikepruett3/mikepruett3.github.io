I am snagging a few albums and trying to finish The Hulk, all while still at the office! 😀
Terminator 3 was pretty decent! I was not expecting the ending.
A round of kudos to the writers for an excellent script. Too bad they charge ten effing dollars ($10) to go see a movie.
Oh well, must get a hole saw kit to drill a BIG HOLE in my tower.</description></item><item><title>Randomness</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/randomness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2003 23:12:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/randomness/</guid><description>I guess that I&amp;rsquo;m being a nice guy today.
I am giving all the peeps @ work a crack at the new Terminator 3, and other movies that I have downloaded recently.
Even though its my effing BANDWITH! Nobody else seems to care, or contribute (i.e. download) anything! All exept for T-Dogg!
T-Dog&amp;rsquo;s my Hero! 😀
Peace&amp;hellip; Love&amp;hellip; and Chicken Wings!</description></item><item><title>Torrentness</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/torrentness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2003 06:41:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/torrentness/</guid><description>Ok, going to go to sleep now people!
