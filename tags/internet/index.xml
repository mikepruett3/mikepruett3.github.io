Thankfully my hosting company got their act&amp;rsquo;s together, and now we have plenty of bandwith to support this blog. Recently post have been just my Delicious bookmarks, which are posted to the blog on a nightly basis. (I will do a follow-up post on how to do that.)

I am having recurring problems where I keep loosing sync on new 6.0/768 install at my house.
Covad is comming to do a line test. Probably going to tell me that I am 14,999.8 miles from the C.O., and to suck it up and like it.
If that happens, must convince my boss to let me expense aÂ wireless T-1.</description></item></channel></rss>
