As a Birthday Present for my 29th Birthday (Today.), my wife bought me a motorcycle.
(Can you believe it?? What a Gal!)
I have been_ pining_ for an older bike, so I can fix it up and not have to worry about some serious monetary commitments.
Well for $1400 and the cost of a 2XL helmet&amp;hellip; (I have a BIG F%^&amp;amp; HEAD!!), I am the proud owner of a 1965 BSA A65 Rocket.</description></item></channel></rss>
