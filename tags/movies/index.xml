If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen District 9 yet, you owe it to yourself to see this movie. The story is great, and the special effects are subtle yet impressive. The director has created a world were the main event is not the Aliens them selfs, but rather their environment &amp;amp; quest to go home.</description></item><item><title>I must have died an gone to heaven!</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/i-must-have-died-an-gone-to-heaven/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2009 23:51:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2009/i-must-have-died-an-gone-to-heaven/</guid><description>I cant believe that this isÂ actuallyÂ a reality, but one of my favorite horror movies has been transformed into a Musical!
Evil Dead the Musical If your like me then you should have been a fan of Sam Rami&amp;rsquo;s first movie.Â ScaryÂ &amp;amp; Hilarious at the same time!</description></item><item><title>General Nothingness...</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/general-nothingness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2003 07:25:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/general-nothingness/</guid><description>Really tired right about now&amp;hellip;
I am snagging a few albums and trying to finish The Hulk, all while still at the office! ðŸ˜€
Terminator 3 was pretty decent! I was not expecting the ending.
A round ofÂ kudosÂ to the writers for anÂ excellentÂ script. Too bad they charge ten effing dollars ($10) to go see a movie.
Oh well, must get a hole saw kit to drill a BIG HOLE in my tower.</description></item><item><title>Randomness</title><link>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/randomness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2003 23:12:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nixdevil.com/posts/2003/randomness/</guid><description>I guess that I&amp;rsquo;m being a nice guy today.
I am giving all the peeps @ work a crack at the new Terminator 3, and other movies that I have downloaded recently.
