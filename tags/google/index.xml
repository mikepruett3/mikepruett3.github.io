      <description>Yes! I finally got my invite to Google Voice (thank you EvilSkill9)!!
So far, so good. Everything looks pretty easy to setup. Looks like Google built in support for SMS messaging, and Voicemail. Aparently you can replace your standard Mobile Phone Voicemail for GV. Too Cool!
I am not sure if I am going to put the Voice App on the blog yet.</description>

      <description>Long day&amp;hellip; and it just keeps dragging.
Hopefully this day will END SOON! :(
Todays thoughts&amp;hellip;
 Google Mail sounds cool. Gmail sounds even cooler,Â but I need an invite. (Please!) Cisco gear is so mother-effing Expensive! Oh, did I mention that a Gmail invite would be Awesome! ðŸ˜€  Don&amp;rsquo;t pay any attention to me, I am just really tired!</description>
