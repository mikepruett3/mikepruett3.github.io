We are now live in the Upper Peninsula, or UP for short!
My wife is from the UP (Park Falls, WI specifically), and has done a lot of research on the Kingsford area. One of the things she discovered is that Henry Ford and his friends used to have a house they used in the summer for shenanigans in the early 1900&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item></channel></rss>
