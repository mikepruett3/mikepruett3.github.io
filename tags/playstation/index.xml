      <description>Not sure if this works, but I am destined to try!
Seems like newer games are requiring the 5.50 firmware, but I am still running CFW 5.00 M33! Where the hell is Dark-Alex gone to?
Oh well&amp;hellip; for your viewing pleasure!
  The instructions in the comments are pretty decent. If you need your PSP to be running Custom Firmware&amp;hellip; let me know.</description>

      <description>I cant wait! I loved God of WarÂ I &amp;amp; II on the PS2, and was really impressed with God of War: Chains of Olympus on PSP.
I had passed on buying a PS3 at launch in 2006, only to buy a much cheaper Xbox 360. I still like my 360, and their are more games out for the platform&amp;hellip; but I knew that one day I would have to get the PS3 as well.</description>
