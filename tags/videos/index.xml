      <description>Really interesting Documentary on the incident. Kind of makes you think about that struggle between Broadcasting Companies, and the Jackers who wanted to take over their airwaves.
I would assume that this trick is still possible in 3rd-World countries where the Media does not have the $$$ like US Broadcasters.
Plus&amp;hellip; Max Headroom was an awesome show! I miss a lot of the older/weirder shows from my youth.</description>

      <description>Not sure if this works, but I am destined to try!
Seems like newer games are requiring the 5.50 firmware, but I am still running CFW 5.00 M33! Where the hell is Dark-Alex gone to?
Oh well&amp;hellip; for your viewing pleasure!
  The instructions in the comments are pretty decent. If you need your PSP to be running Custom Firmware&amp;hellip; let me know.</description>

      <description>So this past weekend I had a chance to see the new movie from director Neil Blomkamp, District 9. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen District 9 yet, you owe it to yourself to see this movie. The story is great, and the special effects are subtle yet impressive. The director has created a world were the main event is not the Aliens them selfs, but rather their environment &amp;amp; quest to go home.</description>

      <description>I cant believe that this is actually a reality, but one of my favorite horror movies has been transformed into a Musical!
Evil Dead the MusicalIf your like me then you should have been a fan of Sam Rami&amp;rsquo;s first movie. Scary &amp;amp; Hilarious at the same time!
