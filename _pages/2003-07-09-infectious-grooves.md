I can't believe that I am **_still_** so sick!

_This really sucks..._

Although, the thought of walking around @ Work and Infecting innocent bystanders with whatever pestilence I have growing inside of me isÂ amusing!

I wonder if I would get fired for sending my Boss home sick? I might just go wipe my nose all over his hankerchief (sic).

There is a reason why I should stay home when I am like this... I have lots of **Evil Thoughts** like these! :twisted:
